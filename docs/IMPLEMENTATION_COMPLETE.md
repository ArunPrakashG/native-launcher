# Implementation Complete: Inline Desktop Actions

## ✅ What Was Implemented

Successfully refactored the Desktop Actions feature to display actions directly inline under each application, similar to macOS Spotlight or Windows Jump Lists.

## Key Changes

### 1. Architecture Simplification

- **Removed**: Mode-based navigation (DisplayMode enum with Results/Actions states)
- **Added**: Flat list structure with `ListItem` enum (App or Action variants)
- **Result**: Simpler code, better UX, no state management complexity

### 2. Visual Design

- Actions appear directly under their parent app with:
  - **24px indentation** for clear hierarchy
  - **Coral highlighting** (#ff6363) on action names for visibility
  - **Left border** that changes color on hover/selection
  - **No extra indicators** needed - everything is visible

### 3. User Experience

```
BEFORE: Search → See "Firefox → 3 actions" → Press Right → View actions
AFTER:  Search → See all apps with actions inline → Navigate with Up/Down
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/ui/results_list.rs`** (Complete refactor)

   - New `ListItem` enum for flat hierarchy
   - Simplified `update_results()` to build inline list
   - Updated `get_selected_command()` for direct access
   - Kept compatibility methods as no-ops

2. **`src/ui/style.css`** (Visual polish)

   - Removed `.action-indicator` and `.action-header` classes
   - Enhanced `.action-name` with coral color
   - Updated indented row styling with dynamic borders

3. **Documentation**
   - `INLINE_ACTIONS_UPDATE.md` - Technical implementation details
   - `VISUAL_EXAMPLE.md` - Visual examples and UX flows

## Testing

The launcher is now running. To test the inline actions:

1. **Launch**: Already running or use `cargo run --release`
2. **Search**: Type to find apps (e.g., "firefox", "chrome", "code")
3. **Navigate**: Use ↑↓ arrows to move through apps and their actions
4. **Launch**: Press Enter on any app or action

### Apps with Desktop Actions

Common apps that include actions:

- Firefox: New Window, Private Window, Profile Manager
- Chrome/Chromium: New Window, Incognito Window, etc.
- VS Code: New Window, New Empty Window
- Many KDE/GNOME applications

## Technical Details

### Before (Separate Views)

```rust
DisplayMode::Results(vec) → User presses Right → DisplayMode::Actions(app)
```

### After (Inline Display)

```rust
vec![
    ListItem::App { firefox },
    ListItem::Action { "New Window" },
    ListItem::Action { "Private Window" },
    ListItem::App { chrome },
    ListItem::Action { "New Incognito" },
]
```

### Performance Impact

- **Better**: Single list traversal, no mode switching
- **Memory**: Minimal increase (flat structure)
- **Rendering**: GTK handles efficiently

## Build Status

✅ Compiles successfully with `cargo build --release`
✅ Zero errors, only warnings about unused fields (intentional for future features)
✅ All tests pass (15+ test cases)
✅ Ready for use

## Next Steps

Suggested enhancements:

1. **Icons**: Display action icons using the `icon` field
2. **Shortcuts**: Show keyboard shortcuts for common actions
3. **Collapse**: Allow hiding actions for apps with many (10+)
4. **Filter**: Search within action names
5. **Recent**: Track and prioritize frequently used actions

## Usage Example

```bash
# Build and run
cargo build --release
./target/release/native-launcher

# Or with debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug ./target/release/native-launcher

# Search for an app with actions
Type: "fire"
See:  Firefox
        New Window (coral)
        New Private Window (coral)
        Profile Manager (coral)
      Firefox Developer Edition
        ...

# Navigate and launch
Press ↓ to select "New Private Window"
Press Enter to launch Firefox in private mode
```

## Benefits Over Previous Implementation

1. ✅ **Immediate visibility** - All actions visible without navigation
2. ✅ **Faster workflow** - Direct selection, no mode switching
3. ✅ **Clearer hierarchy** - Visual indentation shows relationships
4. ✅ **Simpler code** - No mode state management needed
5. ✅ **Better UX** - Matches user expectations from other launchers
6. ✅ **Keyboard-friendly** - Same Up/Down navigation throughout

## Design Philosophy

This implementation follows the Raycast design language:

- **Coral accents** (#ff6363) for actionable items
- **Dark charcoal** background (#1c1c1e)
- **Clear hierarchy** through indentation and color
- **Smooth transitions** for all interactions
- **Keyboard-first** navigation pattern

The inline action display makes the launcher feel more responsive and intuitive, reducing cognitive load by showing everything at once rather than hiding actions behind mode switches.

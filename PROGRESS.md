# Native Launcher - Development Progress

## ✅ Phase 1 - Week 1 COMPLETED

### What We Built

I've successfully implemented the core foundation of Native Launcher. Here's what's working:

### 1. **Desktop File Scanner** (`src/desktop/`)

- ✅ Scans standard freedesktop.org application directories
- ✅ Parses .desktop files using `freedesktop-desktop-entry` crate
- ✅ Extracts: Name, Exec, Icon, Categories, Keywords, Terminal flag
- ✅ Filters out `NoDisplay` entries
- ✅ Deduplicates entries (user overrides system)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

**Files:**

- `src/desktop/entry.rs` - DesktopEntry model with matching/scoring
- `src/desktop/scanner.rs` - File system scanner
- `src/desktop/mod.rs` - Module exports

### 2. **Search Engine** (`src/search/`)

- ✅ Simple substring matching algorithm
- ✅ Relevance scoring (exact > prefix > contains)
- ✅ Multi-field search (name, generic name, keywords, categories)
- ✅ Sorted results by score
- ✅ Configurable max results

**Files:**

- `src/search/mod.rs` - SearchEngine implementation

### 3. **GTK4 UI with Wayland Layer Shell** (`src/ui/`)

- ✅ Layer shell integration for overlay window
- ✅ Centered window positioning
- ✅ Search entry widget with placeholder
- ✅ Results list with scrolling
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Up/Down arrows)
- ✅ CSS styling (dark theme with transparency)

**Files:**

- `src/ui/window.rs` - LauncherWindow with layer shell
- `src/ui/search_entry.rs` - SearchWidget
- `src/ui/results_list.rs` - ResultsList
- `src/ui/style.css` - CSS styling
- `src/ui/mod.rs` - Module exports

### 4. **Application Launcher** (`src/utils/`)

- ✅ Execute desktop entry commands
- ✅ Clean up field codes (%f, %u, etc.)
- ✅ Terminal detection and launch support
- ✅ Background process spawning

**Files:**

- `src/utils/exec.rs` - Command execution
- `src/utils/mod.rs` - Module exports

### 5. **Main Application** (`src/main.rs`)

- ✅ GTK4 application initialization
- ✅ Logging with tracing + env filter
- ✅ Desktop file scanning on startup
- ✅ Search engine integration
- ✅ Real-time search updates
- ✅ Keyboard event handling:
  - **Escape**: Close window
  - **Up/Down**: Navigate results
  - **Enter**: Launch selected app
- ✅ CSS loading

### Test Coverage

- ✅ Desktop scanner tests
- ✅ Entry matching tests
- ✅ Match scoring tests

**File:** `tests/desktop_tests.rs`

## 🎯 Current Status

### ✅ What Works

- Compiles successfully with only warnings (unused code)
- All core modules implemented
- Full end-to-end flow complete
- Ready for testing on a real system

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **No global hotkey** - Window opens immediately, no Super+Space integration yet
2. **No fuzzy search** - Currently using simple substring matching
3. **No icons displayed** - Icon paths parsed but not loaded/rendered
4. **No usage tracking** - No persistence of launch history
5. **No configuration file** - Uses hardcoded settings
6. **Single monitor only** - No multi-monitor support yet

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install dependencies (Arch Linux)
sudo pacman -S gtk4 gtk4-layer-shell

# OR Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev libgtk4-layer-shell-dev
```

### Build and Run

```bash
cd /mnt/ssd/@projects/native-launcher

# Check compilation
cargo check

# Build
cargo build --release

# Run (requires Wayland compositor with layer shell support)
cargo run

# Run with debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run
```

### Expected Behavior

1. Window appears in center of screen
2. All installed applications listed
3. Type to filter applications
4. Use arrow keys to navigate
5. Press Enter to launch
6. Press Escape to close

## 📊 Code Statistics

```
Total Files: 14 source files
Lines of Code: ~800 LOC
Modules: 4 (desktop, search, ui, utils)
Dependencies: 15 crates
```

## 🐛 Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run on Sway compositor
- [ ] Run on Hyprland compositor
- [ ] Test with 100+ applications
- [ ] Test search performance
- [ ] Test special characters in search
- [ ] Test terminal applications
- [ ] Test applications with spaces in names
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation
- [ ] Test launching GUI apps
- [ ] Test launching terminal apps

### Known Issues to Fix

1. Need to handle missing dependencies gracefully
2. Should show error messages in UI (not just logs)
3. Window doesn't respond to outside clicks (by design, but could add option)
4. Search is case-sensitive for some fields

---

## 📝 Next Steps - Week 2

Based on the plan in `plans.md`, here's what to implement next:

### Priority Tasks

1. **Testing**

   - [ ] Test on real system with actual applications
   - [ ] Fix any runtime issues discovered
   - [ ] Add error handling for edge cases

2. **Polish MVP**

   - [ ] Add application icons display
   - [ ] Improve search algorithm (case-insensitive everywhere)
   - [ ] Better error messages
   - [ ] Window positioning fixes if needed

3. **Week 2 Goals** (from plans.md)
   - [ ] Global keyboard shortcut setup guide
   - [ ] Basic configuration file support
   - [ ] Icon loading and display
   - [ ] Window focus stealing prevention
   - [ ] Compositor-specific setup docs

### Phase 2 Preview (Weeks 4-6)

Once MVP is solid, we'll add:

- Fuzzy search with `nucleo` crate
- Usage tracking and frequency ranking
- Icon theme integration
- TOML configuration file
- Hot-reload configuration
- Performance benchmarks

---

## 🎨 Architecture Highlights

### Clean Separation of Concerns

- **desktop**: Data layer (parsing, scanning)
- **search**: Business logic (matching, scoring)
- **ui**: Presentation layer (GTK4 widgets)
- **utils**: Infrastructure (exec, eventually icons, config)

### Async-Ready

- Uses `tokio` for async runtime (not heavily utilized yet)
- `async-channel` for future IPC needs

### Extensible

- Modular design makes adding plugins easy
- Clear interfaces between layers
- Configuration-driven behavior (when config is added)

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **freedesktop-desktop-entry** crate handles desktop file complexity
2. **gtk4-layer-shell** makes Wayland integration straightforward
3. **tracing** provides excellent logging infrastructure
4. Rust's type system caught many bugs at compile time

### Challenges

1. **freedesktop-desktop-entry API** - Took some trial/error to get right
2. **GTK4 Rust bindings** - Documentation could be better
3. **Layer shell setup** - Required understanding of Wayland protocols
4. **Closures and cloning** - Had to add Clone derives for UI widgets

### Best Practices Applied

- Used `anyhow` for error handling with context
- Structured logging with tracing
- Separated UI from business logic
- Used builder patterns for GTK widgets
- Comprehensive inline documentation

---
